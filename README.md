# Citi Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze data gathered from New York City to see whether such a program could work in Des Moines, IA.

## Data
Data was downloaded from Citi Bike for August of 2019 from New York City

## Results
The first piece of data analyzed shows the customer base of subscribers vs more opportunistic customers. As you can see, there are approximately 2.3 million customers, with 1.9 million of those being subscribers. That would mean the market for bike share is made up of approximately 0.4 million customers.

This data below shows the peak usage hours. The picture below clearly shows the peak usage times were 5-7pm and 8-10am.  This indicates the bikesharing was used heavily during commutes to and from work.

The checkout times were analyzed next, as seen below.  It shows that f=most of the time spent on the bikes was very short, under 20 min.

The next data analyzed was gender.  When added to the previous graphic, it showed that of that group, most of the riders were male, as well as the disproportionate number of females represented.

By using a heatmap and a collaberations of weeks represented, as well as by time of day, you can see the reading of the bar graph from earlier is validated to show the most usage is done before and after work on weekdays, with a higher number throughout the weekend for recreational use.

We then usde this heatmap to differentiate between the genders, showing the same information for both males and females.  They both use it more heavily before and after work, as well as recreationally. It also shows a higher prevelance of males using the service than females.

Finally, the last heat map seen below, is a culmination of all the information.  It shows that although the recreational customer is about the same between genders, the subscriber that utilizes the bike share is male, and it is used more often during the work week.

# Summary
Seeing the visualization of the data makes it clear. The primary user for the Citi Bike service in New York City are male subscribers, who utilize it for commuting purposes.  Weekends is where you will see more recreational usage.  Marketing towards women could greatly benefit Citi Bike and add to the consumer base as it is being implemented.

Since the income source of Citi Bikes is not weighed heavily by tourists, but by male, local subscribers, it would be easy to implement it in Des Moines Iowa.  A marketing program would need to be implemented to both the men and women.  The marketing for males in NYC seems to be working, so minor tweaking for the demographics in Des Moines would need to be made.  A new marketing strategy would need to be cultivated for the women of this area for it to succeed better than in NYC. 

Three additional visualizations that may reinforce the decision to set up a Citi Bike in Des Moines are:

* Use weather related data, to show how the weather effects Citi Bikes usage with both subscribers and customers.
* Use the entire year in conjunction with the weather to determine if it is a factor, and how much of a factor bad weather plays into the overall usage.
* Also, another demographic to look at would be looking at age and usage.  This way, some marketing could be done to target that specific group of people who use the bikesharing the most.
